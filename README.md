# DemonHack 2018

This project brought to you by Tanya Rachel and Michael from Northwestern University's Master of Science in Analytics!

We built and submitted this project during the DemonHacks hackathon the weekend of October 20th, 2018. Our goal was to learn more about the way data science and machine learning services can be productized and exposed to end users.
